Hi! Iâ€™m a PhD Candidate in Technology & Operations at the Ross School of Business, University of Michigan. My advisors are [Stephen Leider](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/stephenleider/bio) and [Ruslan Momot](https://ruslanmomot.info/).

I am broadly interested in understanding consumer behavior related to privacy. I conduct laboratory experiments to study how consumers make privacy-related decisions.
